# Kevix

This was a favorite name given to my DiskSan project I did in the past by my firms local techs. I will share more of it as I get time. 

Basically, at the time we leased machines so we needed to sanitize them before returning them to the lessor. This is my project to perform that task in an automated. controlled, and documented way.

It started out as a stripped KNOPPIX then went to custom-built system using Busybox, SysLinux, and the 2.6 LINUX kernel. Finally in v2 beta moved to GENTOO as a base. For sanitization scrub was settled on with random pass switch.
