# Kevix

This was a favorite name given to my DiskSan project I did in the past by my firms local techs. I will share more of it as I get time. 

Basically, at the time we leased machines so we needed to sanitize them before returning them to the lessor. This is my project to perform that task in an automated. controlled, and documented way.
